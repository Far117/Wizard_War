Behind the Scenes:

Fixed some bugs:
    Earth level-up still had some debug info
    Fighting had some minor debug info
    Various algorithms tweaked

Caused some bugs :(
    Token fighting is now broken. Don't even try. It has been disabled until I work out the kinks...


Rewrote pause function, now not a CPU burner! (At least for Linux)
