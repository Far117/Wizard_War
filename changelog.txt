=====================================================================================
Beta 0.8:

TL;DR:

Added new health potions to apothecary
Now enemies attack with their own move pool:
    Bosses have unique attacks
    Player vs. Himself: the clone uses the player's moves
Added a visitable hospital

-----------------

Behind the Scenes:

Fixed some bugs:
    Earth level-up still had some debug info
    Fighting had some minor debug info
    Various algorithms tweaked

Caused some bugs :(
    Token fighting is now broken. Don't even try. It has been disabled until I work out the kinks...


Rewrote pause function, now not a CPU burner! (At least for Linux)
