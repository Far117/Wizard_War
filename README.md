Updated 6/30/14 (Alpha 0.2 Patch #1)
====================================

A text-based RPG to perfect random elements for WW2, the full graphical version.

================================================================================


This is mostly private, but ain't nobody got cash for premium.

Feel free to download/play/make suggestions/fix my bugs/etc. if you're bored enough.

===================================================================================

Currently includes:

Leveling

Procedurally generated monsters (shouldn't every text game?)

Stores

XP (the same as money for now)

Fighting

Spells

Air/Earth/Fire/Water wizardry

Kamehamehas

etc.

===================================================================================

Planned:

Inventory (ugh)

Weapons

Single use items (bail potions, anyone?)

Different areas, with different types of random monsters

Skill-based leveling (whole character leveling as a result of ~3 skill levels)

Swordsmanship

etc.

Suggestions welcome!
